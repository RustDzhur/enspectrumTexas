		question: "How do solar panels affect my roof?",

		question:
			"What happens if my solar panels produce more electricity than I use?",
		answer:
			"If your solar panels generate more electricity than you consume, the excess power is typically sent back to the grid, and you may receive credits from your utility company through a process called net metering. This can help offset your electricity costs during times when your system is producing less power, like at night or on cloudy days.",

	{
		question: "Do solar panels work in cloudy or rainy weather?",
		answer:
			"Yes, solar panels can still generate electricity during cloudy or rainy weather, although their efficiency is reduced compared to sunny days. Modern solar panels are designed to work efficiently in a variety of weather conditions, ensuring you continue to benefit from solar energy year-round.",
